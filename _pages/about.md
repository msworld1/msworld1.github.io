Welcome to my page! I am a 4th year applied math & CS major at the City College of New York, CUNY. I am currently a research assistant in the [Research in Atmospheric Dynamics Group](https://jfbooth.ccny.cuny.edu/) advised by Prof. [James F. Booth](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/james-booth) 🌀🌊. I am also a research assistant in Prof. [Asohan Amarasingham](https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/person/asohan-amarasingham/)'s research group studying computational neuroscience 🧠. I am grateful to be funded by the Goldwater Foundation and previously the City College Fellowship.

Before, I also had great time learning from and doing math with Dr. [Michael Wijaya](https://holdfirst.wordpress.com/), who is my inspiration for studying mathematics yay! 📔✏️

When not working, I can be found cycling on a Citi bike 🚴 or listening to some music 🎵. Copy of my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/8a0xrox1815phcv/MS_CV_P_07_2023.pdf?dl=0). 

<b>Research & Interests :</b> 📚

My interests are in applied and interdisciplinary projects. In particular, I am interested in biostatistics and data science. I am enthusiastic about the application of probability and statistics in computational biology and clinical trials among others.
