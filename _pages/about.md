Welcome to my page! I am a 4th year applied math & CS major at the City College of New York, CUNY. I am currently an undergraduate researcher in the [Weather & Climate Research Group](https://jfbooth.ccny.cuny.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [James F. Booth](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/james-booth) 🌀🌊. I am grateful to be supported by the Goldwater Foundation and previously the City College Fellowship.

I also very much enjoy learning from and doing math with Dr. [Michael Wijaya](https://holdfirst.wordpress.com/), who is my inspiration for studying mathematics 📔✏️. We are currently applying techniques from elementary analysis and theoretical cs to study a subtopic of graphs. 

When not working, I can be found cycling on a Citi bike 🚴 or listening to some music 🎵 .  

<b>Research & Interests :</b> 📚

I am interested in applied and interdisciplinary projects - usually around computational and data science. In particular, I am recently interested in biostatistics and how probability & statistics can be used in, for example, medical research and clinical trials. I am actively seeking summer research opportunities in this area. ~
