Welcome to my page! I am a 4th year applied math & CS major at the City College of New York, CUNY. I am currently an undergraduate researcher in the [Weather & Climate Research Group](https://jfbooth.ccny.cuny.edu/), where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [James F. Booth](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/james-booth) 🌀🌊. I am grateful to be funded by the Goldwater Foundation and previously the City College Fellowship.

Before, I also had great time learning from and doing math with Dr. [Michael Wijaya](https://holdfirst.wordpress.com/), who is my inspiration for studying mathematics yay! 📔✏️

This summer, I am thriled to be joining Prof. [Asohan Amarasingham](https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/person/asohan-amarasingham/)'s research group working on computational neuroscience. On the side, I will also be mentoring a high school research project as part of the [Science Mentorship Institute](https://sci-mi.github.io/) (sci-MI).

When not working, I can be found cycling on a Citi bike 🚴 or listening to some music 🎵. Copy of my [CV](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6xv2q52l2wpw98/MS_CV_P_05_27_2023.pdf?dl=0). 

<b>Research & Interests :</b> 📚

I am interested in applied and interdisciplinary projects - usually around computational and data science. In particular, I am interested in biostatistics and computational biology as well as how probability & statistics can be used in, for example, medical research and clinical trials. ~
