Welcome to my page! I am currently a first-year Biostatistics and Data Science M.S. student at Weill Cornell Medicine. Outside the College, I volunteer as a research mentor in the neuroscience and biology programs of the [Science Mentorship Institute](https://www.sci-mi.org/). I am delighted to be a part of this non-profit providing free and open-sourced research mentorship to students from underserved communities or underrepresented in science.

I previously completed my undergraduate study at the City College of New York. I am grateful to have worked with Prof. [James F. Booth](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/james-booth) 🌀, Prof. [Asohan Amarasingham](https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/person/asohan-amarasingham/) 🧠, Prof. [Zhigang Zhu](http://ccvcl.org/professor-zhigang-zhu/) 👀, Dr. [William H. Seiple](https://lighthouseguild.org/people/william-h-seiple-phd/) 👀, and also with Dr. [Michael Wijaya](https://holdfirst.wordpress.com/), who is my inspiration for studying mathematics. 📔✏️  

<b>Research :</b> 📚

I am generally interested in biostatistics and data science. In particular, I hope to explore into the application of statistics and computational sciences in health-related research.
