Welcome to my page! I am a last semester applied math & CS major at the City College of New York, CUNY. I am currently a research assistant in the [Research in Atmospheric Dynamics Group](https://jfbooth.ccny.cuny.edu/) advised by Prof. [James F. Booth](https://www.ccny.cuny.edu/profiles/james-booth) 🌀🌊. I am also a research assistant in Prof. [Asohan Amarasingham](https://math.sci.ccny.cuny.edu/person/asohan-amarasingham/)'s research group studying computational neuroscience 🧠. I am grateful to be funded by the Goldwater Foundation and previously the City College Fellowship.

Before, I also had great time learning from and doing math with Dr. [Michael Wijaya](https://holdfirst.wordpress.com/), who is my inspiration for studying mathematics yay! 📔✏️

<b>Research :</b> 📚

I am interested in biostatistics and data science. In particular, I am interested in computational sciences and the application of probability and statistics in clinical trials and computational biology among others.
